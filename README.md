# My React App

This is a React application that serves as a starting point for building a web application using React.

## Project Structure

The project has the following file structure:

- `src/index.js`: This file is the entry point of the application. It renders the root component `App` into the DOM.
- `src/App.js`: This file exports a class component `App` which represents the main component of the application. It may contain other components and handle the application's state and logic.
- `src/components`: This directory contains other components that can be used within the `App` component or other components.
- `src/styles`: This directory contains CSS or SCSS files that define the styles for the components in the application.
- `src/assets`: This directory contains static assets such as images, fonts, or other files that are used in the application.
- `public/index.html`: This file is the HTML template for the application. It includes the necessary script tags to load the bundled JavaScript files generated by the React build process.
- `package.json`: This file is the configuration file for npm. It lists the dependencies and scripts for the project.
- `.gitignore`: This file specifies the files and directories that should be ignored by Git version control.
- `README.md`: This file contains the documentation for the project.
